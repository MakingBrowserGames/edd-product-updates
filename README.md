EDD Product Updates Extension
===================

*Version 0.9 – BETA*

# Description

Send product update emails to customers of Easy Digital Downloads

## Features
**Customizable Email Message**. Craft a message separate from the purchase receipt emails that enables you to engage with your customers on a more targeted level when delivering updates to your digital products – whether that's a new edition of your eBook or a fix for a corrupted file.

**Additional Email Tags**. The {unsubscribe_products} and {unsubscribe_products_links} tags drop into emails easily to show customers only those products that have been updated as well as a list of those products with their refreshed download links.

**Complete Unsubscribe System**. The custom {unsubscribe} email tag outputs a link customers can click on to be removed from future product updates. If they click this on accident, it's easy for them to re-subscribe via single button click. Additionally, admins have the ability to unsubscribe/resubscribe customers on their payment history page.

### Additional Features
* Confirmation message on email send ensures you don't accidentally send an email blast before it's ready.
* Custom email tags
